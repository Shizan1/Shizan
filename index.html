   <p>
     Welcome to My Digital Space
      I'm Shizan Kumar Gnawali, and I'd like to warmly welcome you to my corner of the digital world. This is where <br>my journey in Information Technology, paired with my insatiable curiosity, finds its home. Currently pursuing <br>my education in Melbourne, Australia, I've embarked on a path that's been paved with both education and <br>experience. 
<br>  My fascination with technology was sparked during my formative years at the Gandaki Boarding School, where I <br>delved into the fascinating world of Computer Science. It was here that I laid the foundation for my passion <br>in all things tech. The theoretical knowledge I gained was complemented by hands-on projects and the joy <br>of solving real-world problems. 

<br>  Continuing my educational voyage, I joined Solidarity International Academy, where my love for technology <br>continued to grow. The camaraderie of my fellow students and the guidance of my educators further fueled <br>my inquisitiveness. The quest for knowledge pushed me to explore new horizons and deepen my<br> understanding of Information Technology. 

<br>  Now, as a student at Torrens University Australia in the vibrant city of Melbourne, I'm excited to embrace new <br>opportunities and challenges. Here, I'm gaining not just academic knowledge but also valuable insights into<br> the practical aspects of the IT field. I believe in the power of continuous learning, and I'm dedicated to <br>expanding my skill set, understanding emerging technologies, and staying updated with the ever-evolving IT <br>landscape. 

<br>  My professional journey has been an exciting blend of roles and experiences. I've had the privilege to work in <br>diverse environments. In a previous role at the Maven Consulting Group in Pokhara, I had the Honor of <br>serving as part of the help desk team. This experience not only strengthened my problem-solving skills but <br>also taught me the importance of providing effective support to clients. Furthermore, I have worked as a<br> cleaner and contributed to maintaining a hygienic environment at McDonald's, which instilled a strong work ethic <br>and a deep appreciation for teamwork. 

<br>  As I stand at the crossroads of academia and industry experience, my aspirations are firmly rooted in the IT field. <br>I'm actively seeking opportunities for internships, part-time positions, or any role that allows me to apply <br>my passion for technology, work collaboratively with experts, and contribute to innovative projects. <br>Whether it's coding, system administration, cybersecurity, or any other facet of IT, I'm eager to embrace the <br>challenges and learning opportunities that come my way. 

<br>  This website is not just a digital portfolio; it's a reflection of my journey and my vision for the future. I invite you <br>to connect with me and be a part of this exciting adventure. Whether you're a fellow IT enthusiast, an <br>industry expert, or someone who simply wants to engage in meaningful conversations, I'm here to build <br>connections, share insights, and learn from one another. 

<br> Join me on this exhilarating expedition into the dynamic world of Information Technology. Together, we can <br>explore, innovate, and make a positive impact in this ever-advancing field. Thank you for visiting, and I look <br>forward to the exciting experiences and discoveries that lie ahead. </p>
